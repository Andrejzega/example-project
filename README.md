# example-project
An example project to demonstrate the use of GitHub for a school project.

## Description
This is an empty repo with a few commits to show how Git can be used and how changes made through commits work.

## What I've learned
- How to use commits to make changes to the main branch.
- How to see what changes were made in a certain commit.

## Fun fact
- Git only took 10 days to develop.
